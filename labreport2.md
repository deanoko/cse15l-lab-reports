`Part3: What I learned`

- During this learning experience, I acquired the knowledge of accessing ieng6 servers. I also learned how to run a server on my own computer and access websites via the new server port. For instance, after running Java and initiating the server, I can simply open a web browser on my computer and visit http://localhost:4000.
Additionally, I gained insight into downloading and using Visual Studio to connect to the server efficiently.
